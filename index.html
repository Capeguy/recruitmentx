                  The sports cell is responsible for several events throughout the year, the highlight being IFG.
                  This year our aim is to recruit members who are passionate about creating a sporting environment
                  here in SoC. Some events in which we will be undertaking would be Sports camp, IFG,
                  possibly Sports week bi-weekly sports games.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A Sport’s Comm member should be willing to give up time (especially on the weekends during IFG period)
                  to come down and support your fellow faculty peers as they compete in their respective IFG games.
                  Through your time in the Sport’s Comm I wish you’ll not only be able to develop your character
                  but also make the MC part of your family.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I hope that through the 19th MC’s Sport’s cell, we will be able to invoke a positive change in SoC’s sports culture.

                <p>
                  Logistics Cell aims to support all the NUS Students’ Computing Club related events to the best of our ability.
                  Besides, this 19th Logistics Cell should uphold the spirit of all-for-one,
                  one-for-all kind of mentality so as to bond well and eventually be able to work well together
                  by harnessing one another’s strengths and weaknesses.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Next, as members of the Logistics cell, we should also take note and raise any cleanliness issue
                  (Computing Club and Student Lounge) as well as furniture damage (tables, chairs and etc)
                  because we are students as well and we definitely want the best for our student body.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Lastly, I hope that every member in the Logistics Cell would have the chance
                  to learn to take up certain responsibilities such as being the “In-charge” for certain roles.
                  The roles would be rotational monthly and this would allow members of Logistics Cell
                  to not only know how to work hard, but also learn something out of it.
